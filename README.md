 That would be messed up
 
 * ALso you can enter any word into the translator but words that are stored inside the text file require the format of ( Capital spanish word space Capital english word.
 
 * In addition there are 3 commands 
 
  -ACT#1 : Adds a spanish word and english definition to the file
  
  -ACT#2 : Deletes a word from the text file
  
  -ACT#3 : Replaces a word in the text file
  
  * After downloading the installer set the location that you want your exexutable in and send the executable to desktop.
